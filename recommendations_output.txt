Which stocks is a rise for couple of months, and has growth and will grow
Based on current trends: 
- Intel (INTC) has positive response to government support and bullish technical indicators.
- NVIDIA (NVDA) shows 60% upside potential with strong market momentum.
- CVET is recommended for buy-and-hold strategy accumulating potential through 2025.
- Broadcom (AVGO) has potential buyer interest from Intel.
- SMCI offers successful trading setups leading to significant profit-making opportunities.
- Alibaba (BABA) is steady for near-term earnings but not recommended for long-term investment. Based on the provided information, stocks with growth potential include Taiwan Semiconductor and Broadcom. Bull cases are seen in Palantir Technologies, Snowflake, GitLab, Grab Holdings, XRP, Chainlink, and Filecoin, while bear cases are for Bear Case: Ethereum, Wrapped Bitcoin, and Grayscale Trust. Reasons to rise include growth prospects in AI, strong business partnerships, and potential market dominance. However, risks involve volatility and competitive challenges. The stocks to watch are Chainlink, Algorand, Avalanche, and Dogecoin. Based on recent trends and market analysis, the following stocks are recommended for potential growth: Stellar Lumens (XLM), Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH). Please conduct further research and monitor closely. I recommend avoiding stocks like Altus Power (AMS), Paysign Inc (PYS), Talkspace (TK), Livongo Health (LVGO), and Tilab Biotech (TTEA) due to erratic performance and unreliable growth potential. Consider partnering with Nickel (NKE) and Cake Factory (CAKE) for increased sales. Esteelauder (EL) has seen a 5% rise and potential for further gains. Cake (CAKE) has shown a 4.5% increase with promising revenue and profitability growth. Keep an eye on the promising technology stock Softi (SOFI). Based on the analysis, MetA has potential for a 4% increase. Uber has seen significant gains. Nvidia is anticipated to rise further, while Crowdstrike showed a 5% increase this week. Based on recent performance and potential growth, consider investing in NFLX for positive returns. Stay cautious but watch for potential rise in PLTR and NVDA as well. Monitor CRWD and AMZN for solid track records. CVNA shows upward trend and strong resistance level at $271.UBER trending up. BYND indicates potential breakout towards $295-$320 levels. CVNA potentially ticking past $295 before earnings. Keep track of BA, a long-term decline but ripe for recovery. As a financial analyst, I recommend monitoring potential growth opportunities in NVDA, AMZN, SERV, PYPL, and TSLA due to innovative developments and market potential. These stocks exhibit strong fundamentals and could reverse recent trends with breakout potential. - **Uber Technologies (UBER)**: Strong partnership with SERV, potential to enhance delivery services and technology connection.
- **Chipotle (CMG)**: Testing customized delivery robots in California, partnership offers efficiency and cost-savings. 
- **Walmart (WMT)**: Participating in pilot programs with SERV for automated delivery, potential for innovation and brand reputation.
- **Grab Holdings (GRAB)**: Potential for revenue growth and delivery services enhancements, innovative methods could enhance customer experience and brand reputation. - Tesla (TSLA) has strong growth potential.
- Apple (AAPL) is expected to continue rising.
- Amazon (AMZN) has attractive long-term investment potential.
