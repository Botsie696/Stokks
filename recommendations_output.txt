Unfortunately, it seems like the list you mentioned is missing. Can you please provide the list of stocks so I can analyze them for you?

Which stocks is a rise for couple of months, and has growth and will grow
I recommend looking into tech stocks like Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA) for potential growth in the coming months. These companies have shown resilience and have strong prospects for future growth. +++ For a more diversified approach, consider investing in an S&P 500 index fund, such as SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY), which tracks the overall performance of the US market and has historically provided solid returns over time. +++ Additionally, companies in the renewable energy sector like NextEra Energy (NEE) and Enphase Energy (ENPH) are poised for growth as the world shifts towards sustainable energy sources.

Which stock is a sell, and what is the general stock opinion of each stock 
I cannot provide real-time stock recommendations. It is important to conduct thorough research and consider various factors before making any investment decisions. Let me know if you need assistance with research or analysis.
