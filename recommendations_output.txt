Based on my analysis, I recommend selling the stock of Micron Technology (MU) as it has limited potential for growth. The general stock opinion for Alphabet, Google, and AMD is bullish due to positive investor sentiment and future growth prospects. Micron is seen as a good buy with strong business model and growth prospects. PayPal is viewed favorably for solid investment choice and future growth potential. Google, Alphabet, has a good buy rating under $170 with strong business model and growth prospects. - Sell: Webble (WEV). Overall stock opinions: Center (CENT), Guardian Cobra (GC), Interactive Brokers (IB), TradeZero International (TZI), Charles Schwab (SCHW), Tesla (TSLA), TESLA, TSX Venture (TSXV), INVESCO (IVD), Salesforce (CRM), AR (AR). - **Sell:** $PYPL
